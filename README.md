# Leaflet Marker Map – Internship Task

## Overview

This project is a simple interactive web map built using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/). It was created as part of an internship task to demonstrate basic skills in:

- JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Working with third-party libraries (Leaflet)
- Event handling (e.g., map clicks)
- Using localStorage for persistent data
- Dynamically creating and managing UI elements (e.g., popups, buttons)

The map is centered on Germany and allows users to add, view, and delete custom markers with optional comments.
